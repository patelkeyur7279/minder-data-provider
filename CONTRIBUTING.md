## 🏗️ Project Architecture

Understanding the structure is key to contributing effectively.

```
src/
├── auth/           # Authentication Manager (JWT, Storage, Refresh)
├── cache/          # Cache Manager (Redux + TanStack Query integration)
├── config/         # Global Configuration logic
├── core/           # Core logic (ApiClient, MinderDataProvider)
├── crud/           # CRUD operation helpers
├── debug/          # Debug tools and loggers
├── hooks/          # Public React Hooks (useMinder, useAuth, etc.)
├── platforms/      # Platform-specific adapters (Web, Native, Electron)
├── ssr/            # Server-Side Rendering helpers
├── utils/          # Shared utilities (Logger, Security, Validation)
└── index.ts        # Main entry point
```

### Key Concepts
- **Hybrid Architecture**: We use Redux for global synchronous state (Auth, UI) and TanStack Query for asynchronous server state (Data Fetching).
- **Platform Agnostic**: Core logic is separated from platform-specific code (handled by `PlatformDetector`).
- **Manager Pattern**: Features are encapsulated in Managers (`AuthManager`, `CacheManager`, `ProxyManager`) to keep `useMinder` clean.

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow a strict naming convention for branches:

- `feat/description`: New features (e.g., `feat/add-graphql-support`)
- `fix/description`: Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/token-refresh-loop`)
- `docs/description`: Documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-wiki`)
- `refactor/description`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test/description`: Adding or updating tests

### Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Example:**
```
feat(auth): implement auto-refresh for expired tokens
```

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance (The Confidence Protocol)

We maintain a high bar for quality. Every PR must pass our **Confidence Protocol**.

### Running Tests

We use **Jest** for testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/useMinder.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Verify Build

Before submitting a PR, you **MUST** run the verification script. This script performs a "smoke test" on the built artifacts to ensure they are valid and usable.

```bash
# Runs build, type checks, and verifies exports
node scripts/verify-build.js
```

**If this script fails, your PR will be rejected.**

---

## 📏 Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- **Strict Mode**: `strict: true` is enabled. No implicit `any`.
- **Interfaces**: Use `interface` for public APIs, `type` for unions/intersections.
- **Enums**: Use `const enum` where possible to reduce bundle size.

### React
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks must start with `use`.
- **Functional Components**: Use functional components with hooks. Avoid class components.

### Style
- We use **Prettier** for formatting.
- Run `npm run format` before committing.

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

1. **Sync your fork**: Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
2. **Run the Confidence Protocol**:
   - `npm test` (All tests must pass)
   - `node scripts/verify-build.js` (Build must be valid)
3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Use the provided PR template.
   - Link related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
   - Add a clear description of changes.
   - Attach screenshots/videos for UI changes.

---

## 📚 Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Public APIs must have JSDoc comments (`/** ... */`).
- **Wiki**: If you add a major feature, please update the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/patelkeyur7279/minder-data-provider/wiki).
- **README**: Update `README.md` only for high-level changes.
